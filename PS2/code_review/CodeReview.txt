AddressBookEntry.java
1. As the class is immutable, it doesn't follow the rule of immutabilty: making all fields final.

2. All the property of AddressBookEntry isn't mandatory. When some other class uses this entry class,
they would be obligated to pass all the parameters. Consider using Builder pattern so as to distinguish between 
mandatory parameters and optional parameters.

3. Missing toString method.

4. Two entries are considered same if they are logically same as well as physically same, implementation of 
equals and hashcode method is missing.

5. Javadocs convention not followed for paramerterized constructor.

AddressBook.java
1. As the class is immutable, it doesn't follow the rule of immutabilty: making all fields final.

2. Should check if the parameters passed in search, add, serialze, deserialze methods is not null. 
If they are null, then should throw exception.

3. As the AddressBook allows duplicate values, during search operation, it should find all the occurrences
of the value in the AddressBook. However, if the search method only supports to find first occurrence of value,
that should be reflected in the javadocs.

4. Remove method will throw exception when the AddressBook is empty as there is no handling of this case.

5. Missing toString method.

6. readObject, writeObject methods will throw FileNotFound Exception when file is not found. This exception 
is not not handled.

7. Constructor produces compile-time error, as the generic type of ArrayList is not specified.

8. Deserialize method could be simplified by using String.split in-built function.
